# Northwest DR Impacts: Dashboard Generator

![NW DR Logo](/assets/dr_logo.png "NW DR Logo")

## Overview
This repository contains the code for deploying the dashboard that shows the emissions impacts of demand response (DR) programs in the northwest US. Visit https://demand-response-impacts.herokuapp.com/home to explore the dashboard. Visit https://github.com/NW-Demand-Response-Emissions-Impacts/emissions_calculator for our main project repository, which contains the code for analyzing the data, as well as the documentation for this project.

## Directory Structure
The dashboard is deployed to the Heroku web server using <code>app.py</code>, which uses the files <code>Procfile</code>, <code>requirements.txt</code>, <code>runtime.txt</code>, and <code>assets/my.css</code>. Do not edit these files unless absolutely necessary. The structure of the dashboard is generated by <code>index.py</code>, which separates the dashboard into two pages: "Home" and "More Information". The files <code>pages/home.py</code> and <code>pages/more_info.py</code> contain the code which creates the pages. Each of these scripts calls on the package <code>page_maker</code> to read the processed data files using Pandas (<code>read_files.py</code>) and make the figure objects using Plotly (<code>make_plots.py</code>).
