# Original Demand Response Binning Data and Hours
## Data Provided by Tina Jayaweera, Northwest Power and Conservation Council

The original DR product bins include 4 bins, with bin 1 being the most economically likely bin for implementation. Subsequent modeling discovered that these products were never being acquired by the Regional Portfolio Model, leading to the new binned data. Here, we will calculate the emissions impacts assuming that each DR product in the original bins is implemented. This gives the emissions impact potential of each of the original bins. 

# Navigating the spreadsheet for DR potential: 'DR RPM Inputs_071420.xlsx'
In the "Reporter Outputs" sheet, see "Summer Potential" and "Winter Potential" sections with DR potential for each product in MW for years 2022-2041. In the "binning" sheet, see the breakdown of shift versus shed products and which products are grouped into which bins. 

# Hours of DR implementation

I need to run the top-down model to find the peak demand hours for DR implementation. I have this for Bin 1, but need to troubleshoot this for the other products.
